							<p>The ultimate purpose of ISA is to help the new students out when they arrive Lowell. We have listed everything you need to do and know before and after coming to Lowell.</p>
							<p><strong>When Should I come?</strong></p>
							<p>We suggest you to  come approximately 3 weeks before the start of the semester, so that you will get sufficient amount of time to get acquainted with the system, to search for an apartment and job, submit required documents, talk with the Professors/Students before registering for the respective courses, attend orientation, etc. We further suggest you to arrive on a weekend so that your pickup can be accommodated easily.</p>
							<p><strong>Do I need to get insurance from  India?</strong></p>
							<p>University of Massachusetts Lowell has made it mandatory for students to take the Health Insurance that it provides, so there is no need to get any Insurance from India. But we strongly recommend you to get travel insurance and Health Insurance for 1 to 2 months, because your Health Insurance will begin only after the commencement of the semester.</p>
							<p><strong>How much money should I bring?</strong></p>
							<p>We suggest you to bring at least the first semester fees (unless your admission letter states that you have been provided funding) in form of Traveler&#8217;s cheques, Demand Draft or International debit cards. (We don&#8217;t recommend cash just as a measure of safety). Apart from the tuition fees you should also bring money for covering your expenses for 2 to 3 months. That should be approximately $1500 to $2500. You should also carry approximately $200 worth of cash (in coins and bills)—just in case you require to make a phone call from the airport and/or take Cab (taxi). The amount should be broken into thousands, and hundreds of dollars, and NOT in a single cheque.</p>
							<p><strong>What are the Immunization requirements?</strong></p>
							<p>Please check the <a href="http://www.uml.edu/student-services/Health/Health-Services-Requirements.aspx">student health services link</a>. Make sure you have all the information that is being asked on all the forms regardless of whether school wants that information or not. Also make sure that you take all the specified immunization shots well before you plan to get here (get the certificate/book). You can submit it after you come here.</p>
							<p><strong>Can Arrangements be made to pick me up at the airport on my arrival date? What Information do I need to give ISA to pick me up? What are the policies of ISA regarding pickups and accommodation? Do I need to inform ISA of my arrival even though I can manage my pickup and accommodation by myself?</strong></p>
							<p>Arrangements can definitely be made to pick you up from the Logan International airport, Boston provided that you send us your arrival date and your airlines information at least two weeks before your arrival. Please try to arrive on a Weekend (Saturday or Sunday) so that it is easy for us to arrange for your pickup from the airport.</p>
							<p>Please download the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1i8CFY27ULzujFbkAhMCYbZLks7rT1dGe84-67zerRws/viewform">Pick-up Form</a> and mail it to <a href="mailto:isaumasslowell@gmail.com">isaumasslowell@gmail.com</a>. Once your arrival request is confirmed, we will send you confirmation emails which will include all the information along with the person&#8217;s details picking you up from the airport.</p>
							<p><strong>NOTE: Direct admits have free pick ups by the university.Please contact ISSO regarding your pick ups. This pickup is offered only for the NAVITAS students.</strong></p>
							<p>New students joining UMass Lowell must put a request to ISA for pickups (via emailing the pick up form) and accommodation at least one week in advance. If no request has been put forth to ISA one week before arrival, then pickups would be difficult to arrange. ISA will not be responsible for picking up uninformed arrivals. Please don&#8217;t take ISA for granted, this is a voluntary act.In case the volunteer is not ab;e to pick you up,be prepared to make your own mode of transport as mentioned below. Even if your ticket is not confirmed, please intimate us regarding the approximate date, as said earlier, at least one week in advance. However, since accommodation is a serious issue, more efforts to temporarily accommodate (not guaranteed) will be made for the new student.</p>
							<p>It is mandatory on your part to inform ISA about your arrival. Some very helpful tips can be provided to you by a senior about the lifestyle and the events that happen at UMass Lowell.</p>
							<p><strong>What if no one is there to pick me from the airport? What is the Best way to get to Lowell using Public Transportation?</strong></p>
							<p>If no one is there to pick you up at the airport, please call any of the Committee Members. In the worst case (i.e. when no one is available for pick-up), you will have to arrange on your own using Public transportation.</p>
							<p>There are three ways by which you get to Lowell:-<br />
							i) Take a Cab from airport to Lowell &#8211; It will cost you around $75-$100.<br />
							ii) Take the free bus to get to the Subway station. Take the &#8220;Blue line&#8221;. The Train on the Blue Line will take you to Gov&#8217;t Center. Get off the train once at Gov&#8217;t center. From there take the &#8220;Green Line&#8221; to get to North Station. From North station take the &#8220;Commuter Train&#8221; to Lowell. After Reaching Lowell take a Cab to get to your destination. This option should cost you around $15- $20.<br />
							iii) Take a cab from the airport to North station. The Cab should cost around $15. From there take the &#8220;Commuter train&#8221; to Lowell. After Reaching Lowell take a Cab to get to your destination. This option would cost you around $30-$35.<br />
							The cheapest way would be the second option (ii).The most convenient way is the first option (i), but it is expensive. Make Sure that you have enough change ($1, $5, $10, $20). Please also visit <a href="http://www.uml.edu/studentgroups/isa/www.mbta.com">www.mbta.com</a>. This website will show you the whole map of the transportation system in Massachusetts.</p>
							<p>The commuter train to Lowell runs from 7 am to 10:35 pm during weekdays and 7 am to 9 pm during weekends.</p>
							<p><strong>What about my accommodation on my arrival? Where do I look for apartments? How much do they cost?</strong></p>
							<p>The first step that you should take about your accommodation is to write a mail to <a href="mailto:isalowell@yahoo.com">isaumasslowell@gmail.com</a>. Someone who has an empty room or needs a roommate may contact you regarding your accommodation.</p>
							<p>If the above option doesn&#8217;t work out, then you will be provided temporary accommodation on request to ISA (mentioned in pick-up form). Accommodation provided to you may be a temporary or a permanent one. Please note that temporary accommodation will be for only few days (and in some circumstances it might not even be available. However, ISA will try its best for everyone as ISA considers it as it&#8217;s moral responsibility, and so far it has not yet happened, but in case there are more students than expected, then we wouldn&#8217;t be able to provide temporary accommodation to everyone.</p>
							<p>Most International students choose to stay off-campus because its comparatively cheaper and you can stay all year long (as opposed to on-campus dorms, which are closed during Summer and Winter breaks, and are also expensive. For more information on on-Campus Housing refer to the University website). For off-campus stay there are apartments available near the campus. AVailability of the apartments varies from year to year. The rent for an apartment ranges from $800 to $1300 per month (excluding utilities like Gas, electricity, etc.) depending on the size of the apartment. That brings down the cost to $250 ~ $300 per person per month (if you share the apartment, which is what most students do). Total costs per month range from $350 to $500 depending on life style that you choose to live.</p>
							<p><strong>Should I contact anyone from the university after I arrive in Lowell?</strong></p>
							<p>You first have to inform Maria Conley ( Maria_Conley at uml dot edu). She is the International Student Advisor. The office is at 3rd floor,Wannalancit. You should also go and talk to your Graduate Coordinator to introduce yourself.</p>
							<p><strong>What about On-Campus Jobs at the University? What About working Off-Campus or earning money through some other means? Which companies have hired from UMass Lowell?</strong></p>
							<p>On campus jobs are available and generally everybody gets a job with the rates ranging from $9/hr to $15/hr (You can work 20 hours a week when school is open, and 36 hours when school is closed). But please be aware that the Social security rules have been changed and one can&#8217;t get a Social Security Number (SSN) without a valid job offer. And most employers need a social security number (SSN) before giving jobs to students. Some places where you may find work are {Bookstore, Multimedia Labs, Aramark dinning hall, TURI Library, Wannalancit mills, Escort services, Recreation center, career services, office of continuing and corporate education, Parking lot, Tutoring Services etc}.</p>
							<p>Working Off-campus for a international student is Strictly Prohibited. All jobs must be done through the permission of college. Please note that any attempt to earn money via &#8220;Off-Campus Jobs&#8221; or &#8220;any other means(obviously illegal)&#8221; can lead you to problems with the School and State Officials.</p>
							<p>The list of companies that have hired International Students are put up <a href="http://www.uml.edu/student-services/career_services/Special_Interest_Areas/Companies_That_Have_Hired_International_Students_for_Co-ops.html">here</a>. They are listed by Majors so it is very useful and we highly recommend you to apply to these companies when you start looking for Internships and Full time Employment.</p>
